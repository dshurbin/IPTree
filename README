IPTree Library

This small and robust library implements a search functionality over a list of IP addresses
It is based on AVL tree. Actually this is a Tree-Of-Trees. The first tree represents first IP octet, every
leaf of the tree has its subtree, representing the second octet of IP and so on.
First of all it helps to cancel search earlier and not iterating over all space with the addresses.
You may add individual addresses, and You may add subnets.
When You adding either an address or a subnet - You provide a handler, which will be called when the address is hit.
The handler is appends to a handlers chain.
There is a simple dummy function, wich returns 1, just to implement simple search purposes. Though You
can use it in an extended way. For example - check IP port or TCP/IP/UDP header/payload contents. Keep
in mind that each IP can be handled by various handlers - there may be handlers for different subnets, or even
an exact IP may be handled by multiple functions. F.e. some check ports, some check payload, 
some check its nature - IP/UDP/ICMP etc.
every handler has its own unique string (up to 50 characters long), so when adding, we check if we're already here.
May be it is not the best solution, but this doesn't affect search robustness.
Anyway - feel free to suggest things to implement.
